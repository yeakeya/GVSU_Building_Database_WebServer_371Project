# GVSU Buildings Database - Web App Project (Semester Project for CIS 371)

## Project Description

This project is designed to serve as a web portal to access information on the buildings and architecture of Grand Valley State University from a SQL database. The project will contain descriptions and data on buildings on all three GVSU campuses (Allendale, Pew, and Health). A core part of the project will be a crowdsource-like edit feature, in which anyone with a registered account (theoretically, if permanently running) will be able to make edits to individual building pages, or make a new individual building page, which will become permanent if upvoted enough by other registered users.

This project will primarily use the Express package for server communication, and JavaScript / EJS templates in a Model-View-Controller system. The database will be handled on Firestore.

## Project Parameters / Requirements

* App must be sufficiently functional to allow the user to complete at least one useful, primary task.
* App must contain at least two correctly functioning CRUD pages that utilize a database/data store.
* Some content must be accessible to all users (including guests / those not logged in).
* Users who log in may access their personal content.
* Users (whether logged in or guests) are not able to access the content of others.
* At least one page must be styled using CSS such that all components are fully visible and appear in a reasonable place.
* At least one page must use JavaScript to improve user interaction (e.g., validate input before contacting the server).

* App must be sufficiently complete to be of some use to someone.
* Application is not merely a copy / re-implementation of an existing application.
* All required pages must be styled using CSS such that all components are fully visible and in reasonable place.
* At least one page is styled such that all components are correctly sized (e.g., there are not any "jagged" rows or columns of content).
* At least one page has all form elements styled nicely (as opposed to using the raw, unstyled HTML form elements).
* Application contains custom JavaScript logic.

* App uses asynchronous JavaScript to update a web page.
* App must do at least one of the following:
    * Allow new users to create an account.
    * Provide features accessible only to administrative users.
    * Utilize some third-party API (e.g., Google Maps).
* Application is correctly deployed.

* Application must provide some service currently unavailable in the market. Either the application implements something completely new, or it adds non-trivial improvement to an existing app.
* All pages must exhibit near-professional styling (including, but not limited to correct sizing and placement, appealing color choices, enhanced styling of forms, etc.).
* At least one page must exhibit responsive design and look good on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
